# Solution

Create the Liveness_cmd.YAML file and add the probes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    test: liveness
  name: liveness-exec
spec:
  containers:
  - name: liveness
    image: registry.k8s.io/busybox
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -f /tmp/healthy; sleep 600
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - cat
        - /tmp/healthy
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```


Create the initial YAML with the following command.

```
kubectl apply -f Liveness_cmd.yaml
```



After 35 seconds, view the Pod events again:

```
kubectl describe pod liveness-exec
```

At the bottom of the output, there are messages indicating that the liveness probes have failed, and the failed containers have been killed and recreated.
