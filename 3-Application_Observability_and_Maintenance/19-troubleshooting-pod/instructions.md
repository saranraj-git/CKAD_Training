In this exercise, you will practice your troubleshooting skills by inspecting a misconfigured Pod.


1. Create a new Pod from the YAML manifest in the file [`pod.yaml`](./pod.yaml).
2. Check the Pod's status. Do you see any issue?
3. Render the logs of the running container and identify an issue.
4. Shell into the container. Can you verify the issue based on the rendered log message?
5. Suggest solutions that can fix the root cause of the issue.
