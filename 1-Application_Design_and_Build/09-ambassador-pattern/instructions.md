In this example, you'll be asked to implement rate-limiting functionality for HTTP(S) calls to an external service. For example, the requirements for the rate limiter could say that an application can only make a maximum of five calls every 15 minutes. Instead of strongly coupling the rate-limiting logic to the application code, it will be provided by an ambassador container.

The image `bmuschko/nodejs-business-app:1.0.0` represents a Node.js-based application that makes a call to localhost on port 8081. The ambassador container represented by the image `bmuschko/nodejs-ambassador:1.0.0` running on port 8081 will take on making the HTTP call to the external service while at the same time enforcing rate limiting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube or you can use the O'Reilly interactive lab ["Implementing the Ambassador Pattern"](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/implementing-the-ambassador/9781098163945/).

1. Create a YAML manifest for a Pod with the name `rate-limiter` in the namespace `ext-access`. Store the definition in the file named `rate-limiter.yaml`. The main application container named `business-app` should use the image `bmuschko/nodejs-business-app:1.0.0` and expose the container port 8080.
2. Modify the YAML manifest by adding the ambassador container named `ambassador`. The ambassador container uses the image `bmuschko/nodejs-ambassador:1.0.0` and exposes the container port 8081.
3. Test the rate-limiting functionality. First, create the Pod, shell into the `business-app` container that runs the business application, and execute a series of `curl` commands that target `localhost:8081/test`, the end point of the `ambassador` container. The first five calls will be allowed to the external service. On the sixth call, youâ€™ll receive an error message, as the rate limit has been reached within the given time frame.
