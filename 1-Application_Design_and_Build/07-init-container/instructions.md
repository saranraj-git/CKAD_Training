Kubernetes runs an init container before the main container. In this lab, the init container retrieves configuration files from a remote location and makes it available to the application running in the main container. The configuration files are shared through a volume mounted by both containers. The running application consumes the configuration files and can render its values.


1. Create a new Pod in a YAML file named `business-app.yaml`. The Pod should define two containers, one init container and one main application container. Name the init container `configurer` and the main container `web`. The init container uses the image `busybox:1.36.1`, the main container uses the image `bmuschko/nodejs-read-config:1.0.0`. Expose the main container on port 8080.
2. Edit the YAML file by adding a new volume of type `emptyDir` that is mounted at `/usr/shared/app` for both containers.
3. Edit the YAML file by providing the command for the init container. The init container should run a `wget` command for downloading the file `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saranraj-git/CKAD_Training/refs/heads/master/1-Application_Design_and_Build/07-init-container/app/config/config.json` into the directory `/usr/shared/app`.
4. Start the Pod and ensure that it is up and running.
5. Run the command `curl localhost:8080` from the main application container. The response should render a database URL derived off the information in the configuration file.
6. (Optional) Discuss: How would you approach debugging a failing command inside of the init container?
