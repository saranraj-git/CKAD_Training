You have been tasked with creating a Pod for running an application in container. During application development, you ran a load test for figuring out the minimum amount of resources needed and the maximum amount of resources the application is allowed to grow to. Define those resource requests and limits for the Pod.



1. Define a Pod named `hello-world` running the container image `bmuschko/nodejs-hello-world:1.0.0`. The container exposes the port 3000.
2. Add a Volume of type `emptyDir` and mount it the container path `/var/log`.
3. For the container, specify the following minimum number of resources as follows:

    - CPU: 100m
    - Memory: 500Mi
    - Ephemeral storage: 1Gi

4. For the container, specify the following maximum number of resources as follows:

    - Memory: 500Mi
    - Ephemeral storage: 2Gi

5. Create the Pod from the YAML manifest.
6. Inspect the Pod details. Which node does the Pod run on?
