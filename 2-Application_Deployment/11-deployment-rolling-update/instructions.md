In this exercise, you will create a Deployment with multiple replicas. After inspecting the Deployment, you will update its Pod template. Furthermore, you will use the rollout history to roll back to a previous revision.


1. Create a Deployment named `nginx` with 3 replicas. The Pods should use the `nginx:1.23.0` image and the name `nginx`. The Deployment uses the label `tier=backend`. The Pod template should use the label `app=v1`.
2. List the Deployment and ensure that the correct number of replicas is running.
3. Update the image to `nginx:1.23.4`.
4. Verify that the change has been rolled out to all replicas.
5. Assign the change cause "Pick up patch version" to the revision.
6. Scale the Deployment to 5 replicas.
7. Have a look at the Deployment rollout history.
8. Revert the Deployment to revision 1.
9. Ensure that the Pods use the image `nginx:1.23.0`.
10. (Optional) Discuss: Can you foresee potential issues with a rolling deployment? How do you configure a update process that first kills all existing containers with the current version before it starts containers with the new version?
